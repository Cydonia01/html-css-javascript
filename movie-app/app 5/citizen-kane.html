    <h1>Citizen Kane</h1>
    <p>
      Back in the headlines thanks to David Fincher's brilliantly acerbic
      making-of drama Mank, Citizen Kane always finds a way to renew itself for
      a new generation of film lovers. For newbies, the journey of its bulldozer
      of a protagonist - played with inexhaustible force by
      actor-director-wunderkind Orson Welles - from unloved child to thrusting
      entrepreneur to press baron to populist feels entirely au courant (in
      unconnected news, Donald Trump came out as a superfan). You can bathe in
      the film's groundbreaking techniques, like Gregg Toland's deep-focus
      photography, or the limitless self-confidence of its staging and its
      investigation of American capitalism. But it's also just a damn good story
      that you definitely don't need to be a hardened cineaste to enjoy.â€”Phil de
      Semlyen.
