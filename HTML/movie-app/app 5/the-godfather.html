    <h1>The godfather</h1>
    <p>
      From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime dynasties that
      came after The Godfather are descendants of the Corleones: Francis Ford
      Coppola's magnum opus is the ultimate patriarch of the Mafia genre. A
      monumental opening line (“I believe in America”) sets the operatic Mario
      Puzo adaptation in motion, before Coppola's epic morphs into a chilling
      dismantling of the American dream. The corruption-soaked story follows a
      powerful immigrant family grappling with the paradoxical values of reign
      and religion; those moral contradictions are crystallized in a legendary
      baptism sequence, superbly edited in parallel to the murdering of four
      rivaling dons. With countless iconic details—a horse's severed head,
      Marlon Brando's wheezy voice, Nino Rota's catchy waltz—The Godfather's
      authority lives on.—Tomris Laffly.
