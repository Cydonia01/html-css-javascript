                  <h1>The Godfather</h1>
                  <p>
                    From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime
                    dynasties that came after The Godfather are descendants of
                    the Corleones: Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus is the
                    ultimate patriarch of the Mafia genre. A monumental opening
                    line (“I believe in America”) sets the operatic Mario Puzo
                    adaptation in motion, before Coppola's epic morphs into a
                    chilling dismantling of the American dream. The
                    corruption-soaked story follows a powerful immigrant family
                    grappling with the paradoxical values of reign and religion;
                    those moral contradictions are crystallized in a legendary
                    baptism sequence, superbly edited in parallel to the
                    murdering of four rivaling dons. With countless iconic
                    details—a horse's severed head, Marlon Brando's wheezy
                    voice, Nino Rota's catchy waltz—The Godfather's authority
                    lives on.—Tomris Laffly.

                  <h1>Citizen Kane</h1>
                  <p>
                    Back in the headlines thanks to David Fincher's brilliantly
                    acerbic making-of drama Mank, Citizen Kane always finds a
                    way to renew itself for a new generation of film lovers. For
                    newbies, the journey of its bulldozer of a protagonist -
                    played with inexhaustible force by actor-director-wunderkind
                    Orson Welles - from unloved child to thrusting entrepreneur
                    to press baron to populist feels entirely au courant (in
                    unconnected news, Donald Trump came out as a superfan). You
                    can bathe in the film's groundbreaking techniques, like
                    Gregg Toland's deep-focus photography, or the limitless
                    self-confidence of its staging and its investigation of
                    American capitalism. But it's also just a damn good story
                    that you definitely don't need to be a hardened cineaste to
                    enjoy.—Phil de Semlyen.

                  <p>
                    The greatest film ever made began with the meeting of two
                    brilliant minds: Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi seer Arthur C Clarke.
                    "I understand he's a nut who lives in a tree in India somewhere,"
                    noted Kubrick when Clarke's name came up - along with those of
                    Isaac Asimov, Robert A Heinlein and Ray Bradbury - as a possible
                    writer for his planned sci-fi epic. Clarke was actually living in
                    Ceylon (not in India, or a tree), but the pair met, hit it off,
                    and forged a story of technological progress and disaster (hello,
                    HAL) that's steeped in humanity, in all its brilliance, weakness,
                    courage and mad ambition. An audience of stoners, wowed by its
                    eye-candy Star Gate sequence and pioneering visuals, adopted it as
                    a pet movie. Were it not for them, 2001 might have faded into
                    obscurity, but it's hard to imagine it would have stayed there.
                    Kubrick's frighteningly clinical vision of the future - AI and all
                    - still feels prophetic, more than 50 years on.—Phil de Semlyen.
